# 🧠 FINE: Factorized Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Mutual Information Estimation

This repository contains the **official implementation** of the paper:  
**FINE: Factorized Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Mutual Information Estimation**.

FINE proposes a novel **factorized framework** for multimodal sentiment analysis, which decomposes multimodal representations into **modality-specific** and **shared components** through **mutual information estimation**.  
This approach enhances interpretability and robustness across diverse multimodal contexts.
